# Slopless
A search engine with currated sources free from SEO slop. This project also aims to recommend websites to other aggregators and search engines to help them improve their own results.

# Why?
Google and Bing suck now, they're overrun by SEO slop. The internet as most people know it is a cesspool of garbage. The good internet that we are all nostalgic for is still out there, but it's not easy to find. This project aims to fix that.

### AI Content
I want to add an option to filter out AI generated content because many people want that, but I don't want to make it the default. AI content that was prompted and well-curated by humans is kinda fine in my book.
